📌 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive statistical analysis on an HR dataset from an MNC.
The analysis answers 15 key HR questions related to employee demographics, salaries, performance, work modes, attrition, geographic distribution, hiring trends, and more.

It uses Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SciPy to generate:
✔ Statistical summaries
✔ Department/job-level insights
✔ Correlation analysis
✔ Attrition analysis
✔ Country-wise distribution
✔ Visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, boxplots, histograms, line plots)
✔ Text report files for tabular results

All outputs (charts + text files) are saved automatically.
